# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
* The purpose of this analysis was to gain insight on the impact of paid vine reviews versus unpaid reviews. And to show if there is truly a need for paid reviewing and if there is any monetary bias. 

# Results
* These are the results based on the large Musicial Equipment dataset pulled from the AWS server:
* Out of the helpful reviews, there were a total of 963 paid vine reviews and 330093 unpaid reviews, which shows that all paid reviews only account for around 2.9% of the total helpful votes.

* Out of those reviews, 520 paid vine reviews had a five-star rating and 200616 unpaid reviews also had a five-star rating. This concludes that 54% of all paid reviews were five-star, and 61% of all unpaid reviews were five-star.

* As stated above, 54% of all paid reviews were five-star and 61% of all unpaid reviews were five-star, which is a very similar breakdown of great reviews. 

# Summary
* As a result of the analysis, I have not found any positivity bias towards the reviews in the vine program, versus the unpaid reviews. Both groupings of great reviews only differed by 7%, with the unpaid reviews having more great reviews (61% versus 54%).

* As an additional analysis used to strengthen the honesty of the ratings, I would have filtered out all non verified purchases. The verified purchases have weight behind their review because we know that the product was in the reviewer's possesion.
